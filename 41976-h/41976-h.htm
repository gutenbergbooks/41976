<h2>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Far</span> away, toward the other side of the
round earth, far to the east and south of
America, lies the great continent of Africa.
There live many people strange to us, with
their black skins, kinky, woolly hair, flat noses,
and thick lips. These black people we call
Africans or negroes, and it is a little child
among them that we are going to visit by
and by.</p>

<p>Different as these African people of the
negro race are from us, who belong to the
white race, they yet belong to the same great
family, as we say. Like all the peoples of
all the races of men on this big earth, they belong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
to the human family, or the family of
mankind. So we shall call the little black
child whom we are going to visit our little
black cousin.</p>

<p>We need not go so far away from home,
indeed, to see little black children with woolly,
kinky hair and flat noses like the little African.
In the sunny South of our own land are
many negro children as like the little negro
cousin in Africa as one pea is like another.
Years and years ago slave-ships brought to
this country negroes, stolen from their own
African homes to be the slaves and servants
of the white people here. Now the children
and great-grandchildren of these negro slaves
are growing up in our country, knowing no
other home than this. The home of the great
negro race, however, is the wide continent of
Africa, with its deserts of hot sand, its parching
winds and its tropical forests.</p>

<p>So, as we wish to see a little African cousin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
in his own African home, we are going to
visit little black Mpuke instead of little black
Topsy or Sammy, whom we might see nearer
by.</p>

<p>It's away, then, to Africa!</p>

<h2>Our Little African Cousin</h2>




<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE BOY.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Are</span> you ready for a long journey this
morning? Your eyes look eager for new
sights, so we will start at once for Mpuke's
strange home. We will travel on the wings
of the mind so as to cross the great ocean
in the passage of a moment. No seasickness,
no expense, and no worry! It is a comfortable
way to travel. Do you not think so?</p>

<p>Yes, this is Africa. Men call it the "Dark
Continent" because so little has been known
of it. Yet it is a very wonderful land, filled
with strange animals and queer people, containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the oldest monuments, the greatest
desert, the richest diamond mines, in the
world.</p>

<p>Some of the wisest people in the world
once lived here. Large libraries were gathered
together, thousands of years ago, in the cities
of this continent.</p>

<p>Yet the little negro whom we visit to-day
is of a savage race. He is ignorant of civilised
ways and customs. He knows nothing
of books and schools. I doubt if he even
knows when his birthday draws near; but
he is happy as the day is long; his troubles
pass as quickly as the April showers.</p>

<p>Let us paint his picture. We must make
his eyes very round and bright and black.
The teeth should be like the whitest pearls.
His head must be covered with a mass of
curly black wool. His lips are red and
thick, while his skin is black and shining.
He is tall and straight, and has muscles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
which any boy might well be proud. He
is not bothered by stiff collars or tight shoes.
He is not obliged to stay in the house when
he has torn a hole in his stocking, or ripped
his trousers in climbing a tree, because he
does not own any of these articles of clothing.</p>

<p>From morning until night, and from night
until morning again, he is dressed in the
suit Mother Nature provided for him,&mdash;his
own beautiful glossy skin. She knew well
that in the hot land near the equator, where
Mpuke was born, he would never feel the
need of more covering than this.</p>

<p>One of the first things Mpuke can remember
is the daily bath his mother gave
him in the river. In the days of his babyhood
he did not like it very well, but gave
lusty screams when he was suddenly plunged
into the cold water. Yet other babies and
other mothers were there to keep him company.
It is the custom of his village for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the women to visit the shore every morning
at sunrise to bathe their little ones.
What a chattering and screaming there is as
one baby after another receives his ducking!
Then, spluttering and choking and kicking,
he is laid up on the bank to wriggle about
on the soft grass, and dry in the sunshine.
Now comes a toss upon mother's back,
and the procession of women and babies
hastens homeward through the shady pathway.</p>

<p>It lies in the very heart of Africa, this
home of Mpuke's. The houses are so nearly
alike that we almost wonder how the black
boy can tell his own from his neighbour's.
It can more properly be called a hut than
a house. It has low walls made of clay,
and a high conical roof thatched with palm
leaves. There is not a single window; the
narrow doorway faces the one street running
through the village. A high wall is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
built all around the settlement. There are
two reasons for this: in the first place, the
wild animals must be kept out, and secondly,
the village is protected in case another
tribe of black people should come to
make war upon it. It is sad that it is
so, but we know that the negroes spend
much of their time in fighting with each
other.</p>

<p>There is a small veranda in front of
Mpuke's home. It is roofed with the long
grasses which are so plentiful in this country,
and is a comfortable place for the boy
to lie and doze during the hours of the
hot midday. The house itself nestles in a
grove of banana-trees and stately palms. It
makes a beautiful picture. I wish we could
take a good painting of it home to our
friends.</p>

<p>Look! here comes Mpuke's father. He
is the chief of the village, and all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
people bow before his greatness and power.
We must show proper respect to such an
important person, so please don't laugh,
although he is certainly an amusing sight.</p>

<p>He is a strong, well-built man, but his
body is coloured in such a ridiculous fashion
with white and yellow chalk that it reminds
us of the clowns at the circus. The braids
of wool on his chin look like rats' tails,
and others stick out at the sides of his
head from under his tall hat of grass. He
has a string of charms hanging around his
neck; he thinks these will protect him from
his enemies, for he is a great warrior. His
only clothing is a loin cloth made from the
leaves of the pineapple-tree. His good wife
wove it for him. His eyebrows are carefully
shaved. As he walks along, talking
to himself (the negroes are always talking!)
he is trying to pull out a hair from his
eyelashes with his finger-nail and knife.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>This odd-looking man was chosen by the
people to be their chief because he is so
brave in fighting and so skilful in hunting.
He has had many a battle single-handed
with an angry elephant or furious panther.
He has killed the cobra and the gorilla.
He could show you the skulls of the enemies
he has slaughtered in battle. He bears
many scars beneath that coat of chalk, the
marks of dangerous wounds he has received.</p>

<p>Mpuke honours and fears his father, and
hopes in his boyish heart that he may grow
up to be a chief like him, and have as
many daring adventures. His greatest pleasure
is in the mock battles which he has
with the other boys of the village. Each
one must be provided with a wooden spear
and a blunt knife before he is ready for
the game. Then the boys gather in the
open field they use for a playground. This
sport is a serious thing; it is a training for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the hard fighting which is sure to come later
in their lives. The boys rush at each other
as if in dead earnest. Hours sometimes pass
before either side gains a victory.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BLACKSMITH AND DENTIST.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the first rays of the morning sun
find their way through the tree-tops, the village
wakes up. It is the best part of the day in
any land, but especially in all tropical countries.
The women come hastily out of the
doorways, and prepare to get breakfast. All
the cooking must be done out-doors, and soon
a row of fires can be seen burning brightly in
front of the houses. Mpuke's mother is very
busy. She must boil the manioc pudding and
bake some hippopotamus meat for a hearty
meal.</p>

<p>Manioc takes the place of flour with the
black man. It looks somewhat like the potato,
but the bulbs are not ready to gather till the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
plant is about fifteen months old. It is a very
stringy vegetable. The women gather it in
baskets and sink them in the river for a few
days. They must stay there until the vegetables
have fermented. This fermentation makes
them mealy; it also makes it easy to draw out
the tough fibres. The manioc is afterward
kneaded into dough and made into round
puddings, which are boiled several hours.</p>

<p>Mpuke's mother is a careful cook. When
her manioc pudding is taken from the fire it is
snowy white. It is a wholesome dish, and
Mpuke is very fond of it. You may not agree
with him unless you like sour milk; for the
pudding has a flavour very much like that.</p>

<p>As soon as the meat is cooked, it is cut up
and placed in earthen jars, a quantity of pepper
is added, and palm oil poured over it to make
a rich gravy.</p>

<p>The men eat their breakfast first. When
it is finished they sit around under the trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
while the women and children satisfy their
hunger. The manner in which these people
eat is not at all nice, but we must always
remember they have never been taught a
better way.</p>

<p>There is no table to set; no knives, or
forks, or spoons. The savages use only the
kind they carry around with them, furnished
by Mother Nature when they were born.</p>

<p>They gather around the jars and take out
the pieces of meat with their fingers, sopping
up the gravy with the manioc bread. Now
for some palm wine to quench their thirst.
The meal is quickly over. We are glad, for
it has not been pleasant to watch.</p>

<p>Both men and women join in a friendly
smoke. From the laughing and chattering
they must be having a merry time.</p>

<p>But it is growing warm as the sunshine
finds its way through the foliage, and there is
much work to do before the stifling noon hours.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 374px;">
<img src="images/i033.jpg" width="374" height="550" alt="people sitting outside huts" />
<span class="caption">THE VILLAGE</span>
</div>

<p>The women and children hurry away to
their plantations of sweet potatoes, or groundnuts
(peanuts), or tobacco. Some of the men
get their spears and bows and arrows for hunting.
Others prepare nets for fishing in the
river. Every one is so busy that the village
suddenly becomes quiet.</p>

<p>We will follow Mpuke on his way to the
blacksmith, who is also the dentist in this little
settlement. "What," we say, "is it possible
that a savage knows how to fill teeth?" We
discover that his work is of a very different
kind from that of any dentist we ever met in
white man's land. His business is to grind the
beautiful white teeth of the people till they are
wedge-shaped. Mpuke is going to his hut
to-day for this very purpose. His father has
a small looking-glass he bought from the white
traders, and when Mpuke is a good boy he is
allowed to take it and look at himself for a few
minutes. He will take great delight in viewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
his teeth after they have been ground to
the fashionable shape. There is some danger
of his growing vain over the compliments he
will receive. In the eyes of his own people
he is a handsome boy, and needs only the
finishing touch to his teeth to make him a
beauty.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that he will not become
a dandy when he grows up. His mind, however,
is very busy in thinking of warfare and
hunting, and he is inclined to scorn the men
who think too much of their looks.</p>

<p>See! There is one of the village dandies,
now. He is strutting along like a peacock,
and expects every one to stop and look at
him. He has spent a long time in plastering
his hair with clay well mixed with palm oil.
The oil is fairly dripping from his face and
neck now. We certainly can't admire this
style of beauty, so we will turn our attention
to the hut on the other side of the road.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>The man in the doorway is busy at his
work. He is shaping jars and dishes out of
clay. Some of the jars are beautiful in shape.
Wouldn't you like to buy one of them? A
few beads or a bit of bright calico would pay
him well, according to his ideas.</p>

<p>Hark! There is the sound of a hammer.
Let us take a peep inside of this next hut;
we must discover what is being done here.
A metal-worker is making armlets and anklets
of copper. They will find a ready sale in the
village, for no woman considers herself well-dressed
unless she is able to wear a number
of such ornaments. She is willing to work
very hard on the plantation if she can earn
enough jewelry to make a rattling noise and
a fine display as she walks along.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>WORK AND PLAY.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> dentist works steadily for an hour or
so upon Mpuke's teeth; but he grows warm
and tired, and says he has done enough filing
for one morning. The boy has been very
patient and has not uttered a sound of complaint
during the painful operation. But now
he is delighted to be free, and hurries off to
the shore of the river to work on the canoe he
is building. His father helped him cut down
a large tree, but he is doing all the rest of the
work alone. He has worked many days in
hollowing out the trunk of the tree. He has
shaped it into a narrow, flat-bottomed boat.
The paddles are beautifully carved, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
is very little left to be done now except the
making of the sail.</p>

<p>That is easy work. The long grasses are
already gathered, and he sits on the bank of
the river weaving them into a large, firm mat.
This will serve as well as canvas for the
sail.</p>

<p>What pleasure he will take in this canoe!
Many a day he will spend in it, sailing along
under the shade of the tall trees which line the
river's banks. Many a fish he will catch and
bring to his mother for the next meal. He
delights in the sport, and does not seem to
mind the myriads of gnats and mosquitoes
which would send us home in a hurry.</p>

<p>But the black boy's life is not all play. He
has had regular work to perform from the
time when he began to walk alone. He must
learn to make the rattan war shields, shape
spears for battle, and weave nets for trapping
fish and game. In fact, Mpuke must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
ready to help his elders in all their occupations.</p>

<p>The boy has a sister who is nine years old.
She looks very much like her brother, and has
the same happy disposition. She has many
duties, but they are quite different from her
brother's.</p>

<p>She is a good cook, young as she is. She
can broil a buffalo steak to perfection; it is
her work to gather the insects and caterpillars
which are considered dainties at the feasts of
the black people. She weaves the mats on
which the family sleep at night. She helps
her mother raise the tobacco, and gathers the
peanuts and stores them away for the rainy
season.</p>

<p>But let us go back to the river, where
Mpuke is giving the finishing touch to his
sail. As he turns his head to get a cooling
breeze, it brings to his nostrils the smell of the
dinner cooking in the village. He knows he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
must not be late at meal-time, and, besides,
he has a good appetite for each of the day's
three hearty meals.</p>

<p>He hurries down the path, thinking of the
favourite dish his mother has promised him to-day.
Do you care to taste it? It is boiled
crocodile. The broth is seasoned with lemon
juice and Cayenne pepper. "How kind my
mother is," thinks Mpuke, "to cook such
savoury messes. There are few boys so fortunate
as I am. I will try to be a good son,
and, if the white traders ever come this way
again, I will buy her a chain of beads long
enough to wind three times around her neck."</p>

<p>With these thoughts the boy reaches home,
but the whole village is in a state of much
excitement; great news has just been brought
by one of the men. He has discovered a herd
of elephants feeding in a forest swamp only
a few miles distant. He says that he counted
at least a hundred of them.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The black people know that the elephant's
sleeping time is from about eleven in the
morning till three or four in the afternoon.
It is the time that the people themselves take
for rest; but to-day there is no noonday nap
for Mpuke's village.</p>

<p>Dinner is eaten in haste. The men rush in
and out of the houses getting their spears,
bows, and poisoned arrows in readiness. The
chief orders his assistants to get out his treasured
elephant gun. It is the most valuable
possession in the village. A small fortune
(as the black people count) was given for it
to the white traders. The chief's eyes shine,
as he says to himself: "This shall bring down
an elephant to-day."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE ELEPHANT HUNT.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mpuke</span> is wildly delighted when he finds
that he may go on the hunt. But he is warned
to be very quiet; he must not even whisper
as the party creeps through the dense forest.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 370px;">
<img src="images/i043.jpg" width="370" height="550" alt="herd of elephants in jungle" />
<span class="caption">HUNTING ELEPHANTS</span>
</div>

<p>The hunt will be a failure unless the elephants
are taken by surprise while they are
sleeping. The men know that the wind is in
their favour, since it is blowing from the elephants
toward them. Otherwise, the keen-scented
creatures would quickly discover the
approach of their enemies.</p>

<p>Listen! do you hear that queer noise? It
is the champing sound the elephants make in
their throats when they are asleep. The hunters
creep nearer and nearer; more and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and more carefully, if possible, they turn aside
the thick undergrowth of trees and bushes.
Ah! Mpuke's father is within a dozen yards
of the herd. He looks keenly about till he
discovers a huge tusker; he gives a signal to
two of his followers to bring up the gun. It
is carefully placed and aimed at a spot in the
elephant's forehead about four inches above
the eyes. It is a vital spot. Two of the
best marksmen of the party direct their poisoned
arrows at the heart. If all succeed in
reaching the parts aimed at there will be nothing
to fear. But if the huge creature is only
slightly wounded, woe to Mpuke and this
company of men who are taking their lives
in their hands at this moment! A maddened
elephant is a fearful creature to encounter.</p>

<p>Hush! Steady now! Bang! sounds the
gun. At the same moment the arrows are
let loose from the bows. The bullet was
aimed well. It enters the exact spot intended.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
The arrows do their work. The king of the
forest rolls over on his side without a sound.
There is not even a death struggle, but there
is a sudden commotion among the rest of the
herd; it is as though a whirlwind had arisen.
Every animal is instantly awake; the herd
closes together like a great army. There is
an angry uproar, a tremendous trumpeting
and bellowing; the forest echoes and re-echoes
with the sound. The ground shakes
beneath their feet. Madly plunging through
the forest, the elephants flee in an opposite
direction from the men. As they rush
onward, great limbs of trees are torn off as
though they were only straws.</p>

<p>Suppose they had turned toward the
hunters, instead of from them! It is useless
to think of it,&mdash;for this time, at least,
no one has been harmed. And now the
men gather around their prey lying lifeless
on the ground.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Owi?" ("Is it dead?") Mpuke anxiously
whispers. His father assures him of the fact,
and allows the boy to take part in cutting
the flesh away from the monstrous prize.</p>

<p>In a few moments the women of the village
appear, carrying baskets. They have
followed the party at a distance; they knew
their help would be needed if any prey
were secured.</p>

<p>The hunt has been a marvellous success.
It often happens that hunters are obliged to
wait in the underbrush for hours before they
can get near enough for a good shot, or to
gain such a position as to be able to cut
the sinews of the sleeping elephant's legs
with their spears, for this makes the animal
helpless.</p>

<p>But the safest and most common way of
hunting elephants is to dig immense pits
near their feeding-grounds. These are covered
over with branches. The unwary elephant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
who comes this way makes a false
step, and falls helpless into the pit. It is
an easy matter then for the men to approach
and kill him, either with their spears
or bows and arrows.</p>

<p>But we must turn again to Mpuke and
his companions. It is not long before the
busy workers have removed all the flesh,
and packed it in the big baskets. The
monstrous ears must be saved; they will
be useful to take the place of carts in harvest
time. Two of the strongest men are
loaded with the ivory tusks; they must be
kept to sell to the traders.</p>

<p>The party hurries homeward, chattering in
childish delight over the fun they will have
this evening. They leave behind them only
the skeleton of the huge animal which two
hours since was so powerful.</p>

<p>As soon as they reach the village the
boys are put to work. They must dig a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
pit, and bring wood to fill it. A fire must
be kindled and kept burning till the sides
of this earthen oven are thoroughly heated.
After this the fire is put out, and one of
the elephant's legs is laid in the oven.</p>

<p>The women bring green wood and fresh
grass to lay over the roast, after which the
hole is plastered tightly with mud. But the
queer oven is not yet closed tightly enough.
The loose earth taken from the pit is piled
high above it, so that no heat can possibly
escape.</p>

<p>You wonder how long the people must
wait before their roast can be served. It
will be a day and a half, at least; but when
the time does come to open the pit the
cooks will find enough tender, juicy meat to
furnish every one in the village with a hearty
meal.</p>

<p>The leg of an elephant is the most eatable
portion of the animal; the rest of the flesh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
is tough and fibrous, although the negroes
eat it, and enjoy it very much. The women
smoke it, much as our people smoke ham,
and in this way they can keep it a long
time for use.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SONG AND STORY.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been a busy day for every one.
In the short twilight the people gather about
under the trees for music and story-telling.
Mpuke runs to his house for his xylophone,
and begins to play a sweet, sad air. One
by one his neighbours join in an accompaniment
with their rich voices. The African
is a natural lover of music; he uses it to
express all his feelings.</p>

<p>It is a weird sight,&mdash;this group of black
people rocking their bodies to and fro to keep
time with the music. As they enter more
deeply into the spirit of the evening song the
expressions of their faces change; they seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to forget themselves, and become a part of
the music itself.</p>

<p>And now the frogs add their voices to the
chorus. The crickets and cicadas pipe their
shrill notes, while at short intervals a hoarse
sound, between a groan and a whining bark,
is wafted upwards from the river. It comes
from a lonely crocodile who, no doubt, would
like to join the company. It is much better
for their comfort that he remains where he is.</p>

<p>Mpuke's xylophone is made of strips of
soft wood, differing in length, fastened over
a set of calabashes. In each calabash a hole
has been carefully bored and covered over
with spider's web. Perhaps you mistook the
calabash for a gourd, which looks much like
it. It is a curious growth which forms on
the trunks of certain trees near Mpuke's
home.</p>

<p>Our little friend makes sweet liquid music
on his crude instrument. He calls it a marimba.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
The village metal-worker made it for
the boy in return for many presents of fish.</p>

<p>"That is a good lad," said the man, "he is
thoughtful and generous. I will make him
happy."</p>

<p>After the people have finished their songs,
there is music on other instruments besides
Mpuke's. Look at that big fellow blowing
into an ivory horn. He needs to have a
strong pair of lungs if he is going to continue
very long. What a dirge-like noise he makes!
But when the tom-tom begins to sound, everybody
is roused and joins in a wild dance.</p>

<p>The people wind in and out among the
trees, round and round again, laughing, shouting,
and singing, until they sink out of breath
on the grass.</p>

<p>Mpuke is so tired he can hardly keep his
eyes open. He drags himself into the hut
where his sister lies on her mat, already sound
asleep. Listen! what is that scuttling noise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
among the dried leaves in the corner?
Mpuke's bright black eyes are helped by
the moonlight streaming through the doorway.
He discovers that it is a green lizard,
which he knows to be quite harmless. But
it is always wise to be watchful.</p>

<p>One night, not many moons ago, as the
black boy counts time, he found a centipede
close to his bare feet when he woke up suddenly
in the night. He is quite sure that
a good spirit roused him to save his life.</p>

<p>At another time a lizard of the most deadly
kind must have shared the boy's mat with him
through the night. At any rate, he found the
lizard at his side when his eyes opened to
the morning light.</p>

<p>But Mpuke is too sleepy to think about
unpleasant things, and in another moment he
is dreaming of the roasted elephant that will
make to-morrow's feast.</p>

<p>A week passes by. We will visit Mpuke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
once more as he is eating his early breakfast.</p>

<p>A messenger from the next village comes
rushing in to the people. He has run ten
miles this morning through the forest paths,
and has brought word to Mpuke's father from
his own chief. The two men are blood-brothers,
and have promised to stand by each other
in all troubles and dangers. "Blood-brothers,"
you say, "what does that mean?"
When the chiefs were only boys they went
through a sacred ceremony together. An
arm of each was cut till the blood ran, then
the two arms were pressed together, and the
blood was allowed to mingle.</p>

<p>They must never quarrel again. No cruel
words or deeds should ever pass between them,
because they are now bound together by the
strongest of all ties.</p>

<p>But what is the message that causes such
a state of excitement? It tells that enemies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
are approaching. It means war, and preparation
for awful deeds. Mpuke's father is asked
to come to the help of his blood-brother.
Will he join him to meet the advancing
foes?</p>

<p>There is only one answer possible; not
a moment must be lost. The order is given
to sound the war-drums; the people burst
into an exciting battle-song; blasts from ivory
trumpets can be heard throughout the village;
the men cover their faces with charcoal and
hastily seek the medicine-man. He must provide
them with charms to protect them from
danger. Poor fellow, he is the busiest one
of all the people, making little packages of
beads, shells, and stones for each soldier to
wear as a talisman.</p>

<p>The women are at work getting the spears
and arrows together; they must also sharpen
the knives for their husbands and sons.</p>

<p>These ignorant savages make a hideous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
sight to our eyes when the fury of war seizes
them. It is such a pitiful thing that they are
ready to take the lives of their brother blacks
for the slightest reason, and that they delight
so greatly in war.</p>

<p>Now the men hurry down to the river's
side. They jump into their canoes, and are
out of sight as soon as they pass a bend in the
banks of the stream. Mpuke watches them
with glistening eyes; he longs to follow them,
but he has been told to remain at home to
protect his mother and sisters in case of
danger.</p>

<p>He knows already what war means; it was
only last year that his own village was attacked.
Young as he was, he stood all day
behind the spiked wall, sharpened spear in
hand, doing his part to defend his home. He
was wounded in the leg on that terrible day,
and for a long time afterward lay sick with
fever. His sister was so good to him during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
that trying time; hour after hour she sat at
his side on the veranda, and kept the flies and
mosquitoes from his wound with a broom she
made of an elephant's tail.</p>

<p>Mpuke thinks of this as he goes home
through the forest path. Suddenly he stops
quite still; his eyes roll in terror. A huge
serpent lies coiled but a few feet away; he
does not notice Mpuke, for his beadlike eyes
are fastened on a monkey standing on the
ground in front of him. The snake is charming
it. He will force it to its own death, and
yet he does not stir; it is the monkey that
moves. It comes nearer and nearer to the
monster; it makes a frightened cry as it
advances.</p>

<p>Mpuke knows he cannot save its life, as he
has no weapon with which to attack the serpent.
He would like to run, but does not stir
until the monkey, having come close to its
charmer, is suddenly strangled in the folds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
its powerful body. The boy does not wait
to see the snake devour his prey, but hurries
homeward, without once daring to turn
round.</p>

<p>The fires have all been put out. The
women and children are talking in whispers.
They wish to make as little noise as possible
while the men are away, lest they be attacked
by wild beasts or some passing band of
savages.</p>

<p>Night comes; there is no sound of returning
warriors. Mpuke sits in the doorway of
his home, listening; his mother and sister are
beside him. It draws near midnight, and yet
there is no sleep for the anxious watchers.</p>

<p>Hark! faintly at first, then more and more
plainly, the fighting song of the returning warriors
is borne to them on the evening wind.
And now they can hear the sound of paddles
and shouts of boisterous laughter.</p>

<p>The men must have been victorious or they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
would not come home so gaily. There are
but a few more minutes of waiting before the
black heroes enter the village. We call them
heroes, for that is the way their families think
of them.</p>

<p>The men are tired, excited, and stained with
blood. They are bringing home two of their
comrades wounded, and the dead body of
another. They have six prisoners taken from
the enemy. These poor wretches are bound
with ropes; they know their fate too well.
They are now slaves, and must hereafter do
the hardest work for their new masters.</p>

<p>The customs of their own settlement are
different from those of Mpuke's village.
They will suffer from homesickness, and will
have many new things to which they must get
used.</p>

<p>It seems strange to us that in travelling
a short distance in the heart of Africa the
people are found to differ from each other so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
much in language, habits, and even dress.
For, scanty as it is, the style of decoration
of one tribe varies greatly from that of
another.</p>

<p>For instance, in Mpuke's home we know
it is the fashion to have wedge-shaped teeth,
while not far away the people think that a
really beautiful person must have the teeth
pointed. In one village the women wear
wooden skewers pierced through their noses;
in another, their principal ornaments consist
of metal rings in the ears, and metal armlets,
anklets, and bracelets.</p>

<p>Among some tribes, the men's hair is
braided in queer little tails, while others have
it knotted at the back of the head and at the
chin in tight bunches.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE BATTLE FEAST.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is the day after the battle. Mpuke's
father orders his people to celebrate the victory.
He tells them to prepare a great feast,
as his blood-brother, Ncossi, is invited to come

<span class="caption">&quot;HIS FOLLOWERS LOOK UPON HIM WITH THE GREATEST
ADMIRATION&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>A great deal of work must be done before
the feast is ready. Some of the villagers prepare
their nets to catch a certain fish that is
rare and delicate. Others get their canoes
ready for a hippopotamus hunt; still others
search for young monkeys. They must also
get a kind of snake that makes a delicious
stew.</p>

<p>The children are sent through the fields and
woods to gather the rarest and choicest insects.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
The country is scoured in all directions. The
feast will surely be "fit for a king," at least
an African king.</p>

<p>The great day comes at last, and the chief
Ncossi arrives. He is dressed in the greatest
splendour. A chain of leopards' teeth is
wound around his neck; a great war knife
hangs at his side. One of his cheeks is
painted red and the other yellow. The heads
of wild animals are tattooed upon his arms.
He wears on his head a tall, tattered, beaver
hat, for which he must have paid a great price
to some trader. He is a hideous object, yet,
as he struts along, his followers look upon
him with the greatest admiration, and keep
exclaiming: "Look at our beautiful chief!
Look at our beautiful chief!"</p>

<p>The mouths of the visitors water as they
behold the pots boiling over the great fires,
and the savoury odours of the meats greet
their nostrils.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>How glad they are that they have been
invited to the fine banquet promised here!
They act like happy children out for a holiday.
There is no sign in their faces of the
cruel side of their natures which showed itself
in the battle a few days ago.</p>

<p>And now they gather in a circle on the
grass, and begin to devour the good things
the cooks spread before them.</p>

<p>Will you share with them this dish of
boiled smoked elephant? It is coarse and
stringy; I fear you will not care for a second
piece, although every one pronounces it delicious.
The roasted monkey is fat and tender.
You will enjoy it more if you do not allow
yourself to think of its resemblance to a baby.
The stewed buffalo ribs served with lemon
juice and Cayenne pepper are fine, while we
should not disdain the turtle soup if it were
brought us in the best hotel in America.</p>

<p>The side dishes at this feast are the queerest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
we have ever seen,&mdash;frizzled caterpillars, paste
of mashed ants, and toasted crickets. Palm
oil has been freely used in the crocodile stew
and elephant gravy.</p>

<p>Mpuke's friends and relatives are enjoying
themselves hugely. They gobble the good
things in the most remarkable manner. They
are so busy that they are almost silent.
They drink large quantities of palm wine as
well as the fermented juice of the baobab-tree.
Palm wine is very pleasant and refreshing
when it is first made. To-morrow, after
the visitors have left, Mpuke will show us
how to obtain it. He is an obliging little
fellow, and will willingly climb a tall palm-tree
to the very top, bore deep holes in the wood,
and fasten gourds into which the juice will
drip. We should drink it at once, before it
changes into the sour, intoxicating liquor
drunk so freely at the feast.</p>

<p>Not many days after the celebration, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
rainy season began. During this period the
rain does not fall all day long, but comes
down in torrents for an hour or two every
morning.</p>

<p>Very little hunting is done now, but there
are such good supplies of smoked elephant
and buffalo meat it is not necessary.</p>

<p>Mpuke wakes up one morning with great
pain in his head, and it does not go away after
he gets up. He says to himself, "I am afraid
some bad spirit bewitched me while I was
dreaming last night." But he says nothing
about his bad feelings to his mother. He is
afraid she will think of the sleeping sickness.
He does not want her to worry, so he will
wait awhile and perhaps the pain will go
away.</p>

<p>The sleeping sickness is the most terrible
visitor in an African home. There is little
hope for the one who has it. Sometimes the
sufferer is ill for a few weeks only, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
again he may linger for a year before death
comes.</p>

<p>The illness begins with a severe headache;
next comes swelling of the body, like dropsy;
in the last stage, the dying person dozes or
sleeps all of the time.</p>

<p>With our little Mpuke, a day and a night
pass and his headache grows worse and worse.
His body is first hot and feverish, then shivering
with a chill. His mother begins to
notice how slowly he moves, and how hard
it seems for him to do his work.</p>

<p>"You must lie on your mat in the hut, my
dear one," she says to the boy. "The charm
doctor shall be sent for; he will drive away
the evil spirit that is making my child so
sick."</p>

<p>The black woman has a strange belief; she
thinks that evil beings are always near, ready
to work harm. She spends much time in
protecting her family and herself from these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
evil powers by repeating charms and going
through queer ceremonies.</p>

<p>She teaches her children to fear spirits in the
air, in the water, in the trees, in the ground; at
every movement they look for possible trouble
from beings they cannot see, yet imagine to be
following them. If it were not for such a foolish
belief, the black people would be very
happy; but they have one protector to whom
they turn in all their troubles. They believe
that he can drive away the evil spirits; he can
bring health to the sick man; he can make
charms to ward off the attacks of wild beasts;
he can even control the winds and the waters.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE AFRICAN MEDICINE-MAN.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the crops begin to dry up, it is the
medicine-man who has the power to bring
rain; when fever visits the settlement, his
herbs and charms are alone of any use in
relieving suffering. Therefore, when Mpuke
becomes ill, the medicine-man is immediately
visited.</p>

<p>His hut stands a little apart from the others
in the village. It is very seldom that an outsider
is allowed to enter the sacred (?) place.
After Mpuke's mother has wrapped up her
little son, and placed him on his mat, she
hastens to the home of the charm doctor,
carrying an offering of tobacco and palm wine
to the great man.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>As she draws near the hut, he appears in
the doorway. He wears many chains of metal
rings about his body. Funny little packages
are tied to the rings, and are supposed to possess
the power of working wonders. Feathers
of different kinds of birds are sticking out of
the packages, while a doleful clanging is made
by iron bells at every movement of the
"doctor."</p>

<p>When told of Mpuke's sickness, he goes
back into the hut and puts on his tall hat of
panther's skin. He takes some herbs and
wonder-working charms from a dark corner,
and comes out looking very solemn and quiet.
He rarely speaks to Mpuke's mother as she
reverently follows him to her own home.</p>

<p>In a few moments he is standing by the
black boy's side. He makes some weird and
mysterious motions, and tells Mpuke that he
is driving away the evil spirit that has taken
hold of his body. He gives the anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
mother a charm made from the hairs of an
elephant's tail; this is to be fastened around
the boy's neck. She is told to repeat certain
words many times a day, and to draw a circle
with ashes around the hut to keep bad spirits
from returning.</p>

<p>But this is not all that is to be done for the
cure of the boy; for the doctor really does
know many good uses of herbs. He has
discovered that the use of one of these is
almost sure to break up a fever like Mpuke's,
so he steeps a large dose of this medicine, to
be taken during the next three days. Then
he goes away as quietly and solemnly as he
came; the villagers bow before him in awe as
they pass him on his way.</p>

<p>Mpuke is soon strong and well. What
cured him? Did the doctor really have the
power to drive spirits away? Or was it the
medicine the boy swallowed? Of course, his
mother believes nothing could have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
done without the magic charms, but those
who are wise must see that if the herb tea
had not been made and swallowed, Mpuke
would most likely be still burning with fever.</p>

<p>But Mpuke is now well and strong, glad to
be out once more in his canoe; eager to look
for honey in the wild bees' nests; chasing the
monkeys from the banana-trees; feeding his
chickens, and doing a hundred other things
beside all these.</p>

<p>But the chickens we hardly recognise as such,
they are such poor, scrawny things, with their
bodies and feathers all awry; and when
Mpuke's mother prepares a chicken stew, the
meat is so dry and tasteless that it seems
scarcely worth eating. What can be the reason
that the African chicken is so much poorer
than the American bird? Perhaps it is because
it is tormented by such numbers of insects.</p>

<p>This reminds me of something that once
happened at Mpuke's home. One night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
in the midst of sound sleep, they were suddenly
attacked by an army. There were
millions, yes, billions, in that army, yet it
made no sound as it drew near. It had travelled
many miles through fields and forests,
and Mpuke's home happened to be in the line
of march. That is the reason it was attacked.</p>

<p>For a few moments the sleepers were in
a state of great excitement. There was much
scuffling, screaming, scratching, and running
about. Then all was quiet once more, and
the family returned to their mats and dreams.</p>

<p>The strange army was not one of human
beings, but, nevertheless, it caused fear and
trembling while it stayed. It was composed
of ants, much larger than any we have ever
seen in our own country. They were under
the orders of generals who marched at the
sides of the advancing columns. Each ant
knew his place and duty. He was ready to
bite any living creature that barred his way;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and it was a fierce bite, too, for a piece of flesh
was taken out each time before he let go.</p>

<p>For some reason unknown to us, the ants
were changing their camping-ground and
moving to another part of the forest. Such
a small thing as Mpuke's home must not be
allowed to stand in their way, so they passed
through it, and took the people inside by
surprise.</p>

<p>"Ouch!" screamed Mpuke, as he woke
up to find himself covered by these wise but
uncomfortable insects. Then, one after another,
the boy's father, that brave warrior, his
mother, his sister, and himself, fled from the
hut as though a pack of hyenas were after
them.</p>

<p>When morning came the ants had departed,
but not an insect was left alive in the house.
The fat spiders that had spun comfortable
webs in the dark corners were now skeletons,
a baby lizard lay lifeless in the doorway, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
many crickets had fallen victims to the resistless
invaders. Worse still! when Mpuke
looked for his pet chicken, nothing was left
of it save bones and feathers.</p>

<p>Paul Du Chaillu, an African explorer, has
written very interesting accounts of the ants
found in that country. The wisdom of these
little creatures fills us with wonder. Small as
they are, they travel in such numbers that
even the wild beasts of the forest hasten to
get out of their way. They are not fond of
the sunlight, and when marching in the day-time
they prefer to stop in their journey and
dig a tunnel underground rather than pass over
an open plain.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE GORILLA.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">But</span> we will leave the ants and their wonderful
ways for the present, as we wish to
follow Mpuke, whose mother has sent him
a long way from home to gather some pineapples.
The boy's sister carries a large basket
on her head to hold the fruit. Pineapples
allowed to ripen fully where they grow are
much nicer than those picked while still a little
green in order to stand the long journey to us.
They are so tender that when Mpuke has cut
off the top of one he can scoop out the pulp
and eat it as though it were oatmeal porridge.
And it is so sweet and juicy! It is no wonder
the children were glad to go on their errand.</p>

<p>They play hide and seek among the bushes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
as they run along; they laugh and chatter and
joke without a thought of fear, they are so
used to the forest. Besides, Mpuke carries
a bow and arrow in his hand to be ready in
case of need.</p>

<p>They soon reach the place, but discover
that some one has been there before them.
The fruit lies scattered over the ground. The
children look about them in alarm; they speak
in low tones instead of the noisy chatter of the
moment before.</p>

<p>"Mpuke, do you think a gorilla is near
us?" whispers his sister, and the next instant
there is a loud crackling and trampling of the
bushes.</p>

<p>Ten yards away stands the fiercest, wildest
looking creature one can imagine. She is covered
with dark, almost black, hair; standing
on her short hind legs she is taller than most
human beings.</p>

<p>How long her arms look, as she beats her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
breast in anguish! She does not notice the
children hiding behind the trunk of a tree.
She is looking down on the ground where her
dead baby is lying. Has a passing hunter
shot it during its mother's absence, or did it
sicken and die? We do not know; we can
only listen, breathless, to the mother's cry, too
horrible to be described. See! she lifts
the dead body in her arms and moves
away.</p>

<p>When travellers in the Dark Continent first
brought home accounts of this largest and
most fearful of the ape family, people could
scarcely believe in the truth of their statements,
but now every one admits the gorilla
to be the king of the African forest.</p>

<p>As soon as the frightened children reach
home and tell their adventure, a party of the
best huntsmen starts into the forests. If there
is one gorilla in the neighbourhood, there must
be more. No fruit is safe now; the village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
itself is not secure so long as the dreaded
brutes are near. Besides these reasons for
killing them, the people consider the brain
of a gorilla the most powerful charm that can
be used against one's enemies.</p>

<p>While the hunters are gone, we will listen
to a legend Mpuke's mother is telling her
children. It shows how the power of a man's
mind can conquer even the strength of a
gorilla.</p>


<p>HOW THE GORILLA CAME.</p>

<p>My children, this is a story of a far-distant
tribe of our race. It was told me by my
mother, and she in turn listened to it at
her mother's knee. I cannot tell you how
old it is, but it is very ancient.</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a certain king
who was very rich and powerful. He had
many children, but they were all daughters,
and this made him feel exceedingly sad. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
longed for a son to take his place when he
should die. At length, after many years,
he was delighted at the birth of a baby
boy.</p>

<p>The child grew rapidly into a strong, bright
little fellow, and the king's heart was wrapped
up in him. His father strove to gratify his
smallest wish, and even divided with him his
power over the kingdom. Of course the boy
became proud and vain. He was quite spoiled
by the flattery of his subjects and his father's
lavish presents.</p>

<p>One day, as he was sitting under a tree with
a circle of youths about him, he said:</p>

<p>"Oh, how fortunate a boy I am; there is
nothing my father would refuse to give me.
There is not another youth in the world like
me!"</p>

<p>He had no sooner finished speaking than
one of his boy subjects dared to make answer:
"Sir Prince, there is one thing your father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
would refuse to give you, if you should ask
for it, because he could not do it."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the proud
prince, indignantly.</p>

<p>"It is the moon," was the answer.</p>

<p>The young prince went at once to the king
and said: "My dear father, you have never
in my life refused me anything, and yet I have
even now been taunted that if I were to ask it,
you would not be able to get the moon for
me. Must I endure this? Say that you will
obtain it."</p>

<p>The king was troubled. It seemed that it
would be impossible for him to satisfy his child
for the first time, and he could not bear it.
He sent criers throughout the country to call
the wise men of his kingdom together, that he
might ask their advice.</p>

<p>When they were all assembled, and heard
that the king desired them to find a way by
which the moon might be brought down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the prince, they, too, were troubled. They
feared the king was going crazy; at least all of
the wise men but the one who seemed to be
the youngest. He turned to the king and
slowly said:</p>

<p>"O King, there is a way by which this
thing may be done, but it requires long and
great work. All the men of the country will
be needed in cutting down the forest and shaping
timber. All the women will be needed to
plant the gardens, raise crops, and cook food
for the men. All the children will be needed
to make bark rope to tie the timbers in place,
and to hand things to the builders. For, O
King, this is my plan:</p>

<p>"Yonder mountain is very high, and I propose
that a scaffold be built to cover its entire
top; that a smaller scaffold be built on that;
a still smaller, on that; and so on, until the
moon is reached. Then it can be lifted down
and brought to your son."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>The king did not hesitate as to what he
should do. He began at once to act upon the
wise man's plan.</p>

<p>All the men in the country went to work
cutting down the forest and putting up the
scaffold. All the women set to work to cook
for the workmen and to plant new gardens.
All the children were kept busy making the
bark rope and in running errands for their
parents.</p>

<p>A month passed; the first scaffold had been
built, and yet another upon that.</p>

<p>Two months,&mdash;and now the top of the
tower could no longer be seen by the multitude
at the foot, for the people of all the countries
round about had gathered there to watch
the strange work.</p>

<p>Three months, four months, five months
were gone, and the head workmen sent word
down that now the moon was within easy
reach.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>At last it was whispered that the king, who
had climbed to the top, was about to seize the
moon and bring it down to earth. More people,
from still greater distances, gathered at the
foot to behold the great event.</p>

<p>What happened, my children? At first the
moon could not be budged from its place; but
then more force was applied. Lo! there was
a cracking and snapping, as of a tremendous
explosion. A river of fire came flowing down
the scaffolds, which were quickly burned, together
with all the people upon them, and
most of those gathered at the foot of the
mountain.</p>

<p>Most wonderful of all, those few grown people
who did escape were changed into gorillas,
while the children that were saved were transformed
into monkeys.</p>

<p>My children, when you look at the moon
on bright nights, you will notice dark spots
upon it, where the shoulders of the strong man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
who tried to move it from its place were
pressed against it.</p>

<p>Let this lesson be learned from my story:
It is not well to gratify all the wishes of children;
but only such as the parents think wise
and good for them.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE GORILLA HUNT.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> many hours the hunters return.
They have a wonderful tale to tell of what
they have seen and done. Mpuke's father
is the story-teller. The black faces of the
listeners are very still, and all eyes are turned
toward him as he speaks. He says:</p>

<p>"My people, we hunters went away from
this village very quietly, as you all know.
We did not wish the creatures of the forest
to hear us as we crept along, one behind
another. Our enemies, the gorillas, must not
learn of our approach.</p>

<p>"We went on and on, farther and farther to
the east. There was no path; we broke off
twigs and leaves from the trees and scattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
them along on the ground, so we should be
able to find our way home again."</p>

<p>Here the whites of the chief's eyes grew
larger and rounder as he rolled them about in
his head, and looked from one to another of
his listeners. Then he continued:</p>

<p>"As we moved on through the forest, we
stopped from time to time to listen. But
there was no sound of the great gorillas' feet
stamping upon the ground. There was no
shaking of the limbs of trees. They could
not be there.</p>

<p>"At last we came out of the forest into a
wooded marsh. The mud was so deep that
our feet sank far in at every step. It was a
very bad place for us if we should need to run,
but it was the very spot gorillas would like if
they were in search of dinner, for there were
great numbers of bushes loaded with berries,
of which, you know, the fierce gorilla is very
fond, as well as of other fruits and nuts.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hark! there was a sound of tramping
feet. The ground trembled, and straight
ahead of me I counted one, two, three full-grown
gorillas. Two of their children were
following them. They were moving along
through an open space in the bog. Now they
went on all fours, and again they would raise
their great bodies and walk along, even as we
do ourselves.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 374px;">
<img src="images/i093.jpg" width="374" height="550" alt="chimpanzee" />
<span class="caption">&quot;HE SAT DOWN ON HIS HAUNCHES&quot;</span>
</div>
<p>"They looked around, now and then, turning
their ugly, wrinkled faces toward me, but
they had not discovered us. How sharp and
wicked their eyes were! What long and
powerful arms they had! They stopped beside
the bushes and began to eat the berries.</p>

<p>"Mpuke, you would have enjoyed watching
a mother gorilla feed her child. She would
pick a berry, and then make a queer kind of
chuckle to call her little one. He would run
to her, and spring up into her arms. She
would show her love by moving her thin black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
hand over his body, and pressing him to her
breast. Then down he would jump again, or
squat between her legs, while she picked more
berries and handed them to him.</p>

<p>"Oh, those gorillas are strange and fearful
creatures! But the time had come to let
them know we were near by. Bang! went
my gun, and the shot went straight into the
breast of the mother gorilla. She fell over on
her side, with a sharp cry. All the rest fled
among the trees except a father gorilla, who
rose up on his hind legs. At the same time
he gave a fearful roar, and beat his breast, as
though he were daring us to attack him. Before
he had a chance to spring among us,
whizz! flew the arrows from the bows of our
brave hunters, and a moment after he lay lifeless
on the ground.</p>

<p>"We waited a long time in the place, hoping
the other gorillas would come back, but not a
single one appeared. The sun was getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
low in the sky, so we started homeward. It
would not be wise to stay in that damp, wild
place after dark.</p>



<p>"We returned to the forest, and began to
pick out our way. It was hard to find the
tracks we had made on our way east. We
had not gone far before I saw a dark object
moving toward a high tree ahead of us. I
gave the sign to halt. Was it another gorilla?
No, it was not large enough, and I could see
it had a bald, black, shiny head.</p>

<p>"It must be a chimpanzee. He reached
the tree and climbed it, hand over hand.
When he had found a comfortable crotch, he
sat down on his haunches, and put one long
arm around a branch of the tree, to hold himself
in place. He must have come up here to
rest for the night.</p>

<p>"He was just about to close his eyes, when
one of our hunters made a slight noise in the
bushes. Before we could fire, the startled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
chimpanzee had sprung from the tree and disappeared
into the darkness of the forest. You
well know how shy the creatures are. They
are not as bold as gorillas, and will never fight
if they can avoid doing so.</p>

<p>"But our story is not yet ended. I am
very tired. Gombo, will you tell my people
what we discovered as we nearly reached the
village?"</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE RACE OF DWARFS.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great chief leaned back against a tree-trunk,
while Gombo went on with the tale of
the day's adventures.</p>

<p>He told the astonished company that not a
mile away was a camp of the strangest beings
his eyes had ever beheld. He had heard of
them and their ways from his own parents, but
they had never wandered into this part of the
country before.</p>

<p>They belonged to the race of dwarfs, and
the very tallest one among them was hardly
more than four feet high. Their hair grew in
little tufts, or bunches, all over their heads;
that of the women was no longer than the
men's. Their upper lips were thick, and hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
out over their mouths. Their skin was a
reddish black, and their cheek-bones were
high. And the children! They were such
tiny, tiny things.</p>

<p>When they saw Mpuke's people, they huddled
together like a pack of dogs, and hid their
heads. A mother pigmy held a baby. She
looked like a child, while it seemed as though
the baby must be a doll in her arms.</p>

<p>These queer little people were cutting down
branches and making ready to build their huts.
The men came out to meet the hunters, carrying
tiny bows and arrows. They made signs
that they would like to become friends. They
had heard of the banana plantation in Mpuke's
village. They were willing to help the chief
in his wars and catch game for his people if
they could be paid in bananas.</p>

<p>Do you suppose the black hunters laughed
at the idea of help from this group of tiny
people? Indeed not. They had heard many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
stories of the great skill of the dwarfs with the
bow and arrow, and of their great daring.
They had heard, too, how much harm they
could do if they took a dislike to a tribe or
person. They knew it was wise to make
friends with the little people.</p>

<p>Although they were very tired, they joined
in a dance to show their good-will. But the
pigmies had no music. One of their number
beat time by striking a bow with an arrow
while the others strutted around in a circle.
They looked comical enough, for they kept
their legs very stiff and made their faces as
solemn as possible. The hunters would have
laughed if they dared. It was certainly odd to
call that dancing. They pitied the tiny savages,
with no musical instruments and no idea
of tunes or songs.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>HOW THE DWARFS LIVE.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">How</span> do these queer little people sleep?"
asks Mpuke, as Gombo stops for a moment
in his story. "Don't they have any houses to
protect them during the storms? And what
kind of clothes do the men and women wear?
I don't see that they have a chance to make
many things, since they move from place to
place so often."</p>

<p>"Dear me," answers the hunter, "you forget,
Mpuke, what I said about their house-building
when we found them. People of
other tribes have told me that their houses are
like beehives. They gather long, elastic
branches, and bend them over into a curved
roof for the house, fastening the ends to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
ground. The longest branches are placed
over the middle of the house. Shorter ones
are laid on each side, and afterward the whole
roof is covered with leaves.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/i101.jpg" width="375" height="550" alt="Pygmies building a hut" />
<span class="caption">&quot;AFTERWARD THE WHOLE ROOF IS COVERED WITH LEAVES&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"The doorway is so low one has to creep
into the house on his hands and knees, and all
he finds inside is a bed made of sticks. That
cannot be very comfortable or soft, can it,
Mpuke?</p>

<p>"Their only clothing is an apron of palm
leaves, which is very easily made. Oh, these
queer little folk have an easy time of it, but
I should not wish to live as they do. They
have no bread, for they plant no manioc.
They keep a fire burning as long as they stay
in a place, so they can roast the game they
shoot or trap. But that is the only cooking
they ever do."</p>

<p>"How do they light their fires?" asks the
curious Mpuke.</p>

<p>"They hunt around in the ground till they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
find two pieces of flint, and strike them together
till they get sparks, just as I would
myself," the hunter answers.</p>

<p>"Do you think they will steal from us
unless we watch carefully?" asks one of the
women, anxiously. "If they are thievish,
I must hide my ornaments in the ground
when we are to be away from the village."</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid," Gombo quickly replies,
"for every one says they are very honest, and
scorn a theft. To be sure, it would not be
a strange thing for a pigmy to shoot his arrow
into the centre of a cluster of bananas, as a
sign that when it ripens it shall be picked by
him alone. But if he should do such a thing
he would bring you enough game to pay for
it. On the other hand, it would not be well
for you to dare to pick a bunch that he has
marked in this way, even though it is on your
own tree, and he has never asked you
for it. He would feel insulted if you should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
touch it, once he has claimed it for his
own.</p>

<p>"These little people are good friends, but
bad enemies, and we must show ourselves kind
neighbours. As to your bracelets and anklets,
you need have no fear whatever. The dwarfs
do not seem to care for ornaments. Even
their women do not try to look beautiful."</p>

<p>Gombo stops a moment to rest. He
notices that the night is growing late. The
chief rises and gives a signal for the people
to scatter to their homes.</p>

<p>Mpuke is soon in the land of dreams; but
he is awake bright and early next morning.
He is anxious to visit his new neighbours, and
get acquainted with the children of the dwarfs.
As soon as his early breakfast is over, the
black boy hurries away over the forest path,
and soon reaches the camp of the pygmies.</p>

<p>There is a fire in the hollow of a tree-trunk
which the children are tending. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
men and women are busy making their little
huts. There are about thirty people in all.
Mpuke makes signs of friendship, and smiles
at the boys and girls who are so tiny beside
himself. They soon get over their shyness,
and show him their bows and arrows. One
of the boys is very proud of his skill, and
well he may be. Mpuke envies him when he
sees him shoot one, two, three arrows in succession,
so rapidly that the third one leaves
the bow before the first one reaches the mark.
Mpuke is a skilful archer, but he cannot
shoot as well as the little dwarf.</p>

<p>"How do you fish?" he asks the children.
"Do you use nets, or catch the fish with
hooks?"</p>

<p>They take their fishing-rods and go down
to the river with him. He is very much surprised
when he sees them tie pieces of meat
on the ends of their lines, and dangle them
in the water.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"They must be silly creatures," thinks
Mpuke, "to believe they can catch fish in
any such way as that."</p>

<p>But he finds they are not silly. They are
very skilful little fishermen; they are so clever
in their motions, and they give such quick
pulls at just the right moment, that they land
fish after fish in a few minutes' time.</p>

<p>"I can learn a good many things from the
dwarfs," thinks the boy. "I will spend all
the time I can with them as long as they stay
in this part of the country."</p>

<p>He bids them a pleasant good-bye, and
scampers homeward to tell his mother what
he has seen. Our little black cousin soon
reaches an open space where the trees have
been cut down. The grass is high and thick,
but he hurries along, trampling it under foot
as he makes a path for himself.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SPIDERS!</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Suddenly</span> Mpuke has a queer feeling about
his bare legs, as though he were caught in a
net. Has any one been setting a snare here
for birds or rabbits? Surely not, or Mpuke
would have heard of it. The boy's bright
eyes discover in a flash that he has entered
the palace of an immense black and yellow
spider. At the moment of discovery he
receives a sharp sting on one of his bare
legs.</p>

<p>"Ouch! ouch!" he cries, and jumps about
in great distress.</p>

<p>Wicked as Mr. Spider looks, his bite is
not dangerous, and Mpuke hurries home all
the faster now to get some cooling herbs from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
his mother. They will soon take away the
pain, and make the swelling go down.</p>

<p>Mpuke has watched the ways of spiders
many times before, but always at a safe distance.
This king of spiders spins so strong a
web that he can even trap birds in it. He
kills them by sucking their blood in the same
way he treats his other prey. As for beetles,
flies, and wasps, it is mere sport for him to
end their lives, once they enter his castle.</p>

<p>It was only last week that Mpuke discovered
a spider he had never heard of
before. It had its home in a burrow in the
earth, shaped like a tunnel. As the boy was
lying under a tree, half curled up in the
bright sunshine, he saw a spider suddenly
appear on the ground near by. It had no
web. It seemed as though the earth must
have opened to let it out.</p>

<p>Mpuke was wide awake in an instant, for,
as you know, he is always ready to learn a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
lesson from his kind teacher, Mother Nature.
He watched the spider disappear into the
earth again, at the very spot where it had
come out.</p>

<p>"Aha!" said the boy to himself, "I understand
now, Mr. Spider. Your home is
underground, and you have made a trapdoor
that swings as you push it. You
have covered it with earth so no one can
find out where you live. When you hear
a noise of some one coming you creep out
upon your prey." At this moment the spider
appeared again, and pounced upon a poor
clumsy caterpillar who was making his way
slowly past his enemy's home. The caterpillar
was many times larger than the spider,
but what of that? The spider was quick and
cunning in his motions; the caterpillar was
strong, yet clumsy. There were several minutes
of hard fighting, during which the spider
gave several sharp bites and drew blood from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
his enemy. Then, seizing him from behind,
he drew him backwards down into his cell
below.</p>

<p>Mpuke waited awhile before he dug open
the spider's burrow. He found it lying quite
still and stupid; the caterpillar was dead and
partly eaten. Perhaps the spider felt dull
after a big dinner; perhaps he was only
startled at having his home suddenly destroyed
and laid bare in the sunlight.</p>

<p>Many little gray spiders spin their webs in
Mpuke's home, but his mother would not
destroy them for the world. They are great
helpers in destroying the insects which make
it hard to rest comfortably at night. There
are ants of different kinds, mosquitoes in
abundance, swarms of flies, besides the great
African cockroaches that make the walls creak
as they travel along their sides.</p>

<p>Mr. Spider is a real friend to the people
because he is not afraid of these creatures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
although they are his enemies as well as
Mpuke's.</p>

<p>The boy sometimes lies in bed and watches
the battles fought by the spiders. There is
one old fellow whose web is spun near
Mpuke's head. He must be quite old, yet
he is very quick, and always on the watch for
his prey.</p>

<p>"I believe he never sleeps," thinks the boy,
"at least I never yet saw his eyes closed. And,
oh, my! what an appetite he has; although he
eats so much, yet he does not seem to grow
any fatter."</p>

<p>Mpuke likes to tell his playmates of the
way in which this old gray spider mastered
an immense roach. The roach was walking
grandly along one day, with no thought of any
one interfering with his dignity, when out
pounced Mr. Spider from behind and jumped
upon his back. It would have been easy
enough for the roach to walk off with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
enemy, if the spider had not clung with its
hairy hind feet to the wall. They seemed to
have hooks on the ends and dug into the bark,
holding the spider and its prey in the spot
where the attack was first made.</p>

<p>Now the battle began in earnest. They
fought as fiercely as two panthers. It sometimes
seemed as though the roach would win
the victory and carry off the spider, but the
latter managed to reach over to his enemy's
neck and give him a severe bite. The pain
must have been great. He grew weaker and
weaker, and, after two or three more bites, he
gave up the battle. Mr. Spider had won a
prize.</p>

<p>Some people say that it will be fair weather
to-day because there are so many fresh cobwebs
on the grass. They do not know why
that is a good sign, but Mpuke knows. He
has often watched spiders at work, and seen
the half-liquid substance drawn out from tiny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
tubes in the body. As it reaches the air it
hardens into the silk threads which are guided
into place by the spider's hind legs. This odd
substance is made in an organ called the spinneret,
at the very end of the spider's body.
He can draw it out as he pleases, but it takes
time to make it, so he is never wasteful. He
therefore does not spin a web unless he feels
quite sure the winds and rains will not
spoil it. He has wonderful senses by which
he hears and feels things which are not heard
or felt by human beings. He rarely makes
a mistake in his judgment of the probable
weather.</p>

<p>Did you ever see a spider's web propped up
by a tiny twig? The threads are quite elastic,
and after a time become stretched so that the
web sags. Then the clever little workman
feels that it can be made to last longer if it is
strengthened. He looks around until he discovers
the right kind of prop, and puts it into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
place much as a carpenter straightens a leaning
building. The spider has certainly learned
many things in Mother Nature's workshop.</p>

<p>But how does Mpuke spend the afternoon
after he has returned from the camp of the
dwarfs? He finds the women of the village
starting on an excursion after land-crabs.</p>

<p>"Would you like to go?" asks his mother.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LAND-CRABS.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> black men are very fond of the meat
of the crabs, but they think it is woman's work
to kill them. Mpuke is not so old, however,
but that he is willing to go with his mother.
It is great sport to get the crabs excited, and
to see them, scuttling around, ready to attack
their foes. Their anger is really amusing, and
Mpuke is not the least bit afraid of them.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of these land-crabs.
Some have beautiful red shells, while others
are of a bright blue, but the ones best for eating
are gray.</p>

<p>The party carry baskets and sharp knives,
and, going down to the river, are soon paddling
merrily along in their canoes. Mpuke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
entertains the women by singing a funny song,
and mimicking the ways of the little dwarfs.</p>

<p>Hark! what is that slow, swishing sound of
the water? It may be a herd of hippopotami
bathing in the river. The women do
not care to meet them, so they look anxiously
ahead. They see the heads of the hippopotami
reaching out of the water, but they are a
long way ahead. They will reach the island
where the land-crabs are found before they
come too near the great beasts. The boats
are soon drawn up on the low shore. Each
one carries a knife and basket, and the hunt
begins.</p>

<p>The feet sink into the black mud at every
step, but there are no fine shoes to be spoiled,
nor long dresses to hold up. The black
women do not seem to be troubled by the
difficult walking, for no harm can befall them.</p>

<p>Mpuke goes ahead, and is the first one to
find traces of the crabs. He discovers a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of their burrows close together in the
muddy soil. And, look! here comes an old
grandfather crab to meet him. The old fellow
brandishes one of his huge claws like a club,
as if to say, "Don't dare to touch me, sir, or
I'll knock you down."</p>

<p>Back of the old grandfather comes a whole
army of crabs, some big, some little. There
are fathers and mothers, aunts and uncles,
children, and grandchildren. Some stand
ready to fight, others run away in terror.
Mpuke and the women are as busy as bees,
chasing and catching their prey.</p>

<p>Watch our black cousin as he rushes upon
this big crab. He strikes the back of the
creature with a stout stick, and partially stuns
it by the blow. At the same moment he
seizes one of its great claws and tears it skilfully
from the body. It is done in an instant,
and Mr. Crab is now at his mercy.</p>

<p>But the next time Mpuke is not so successful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
He strikes a good blow, but the crab
manages to get away, and scuttles toward his
own burrow. Mpuke springs forward, and
knocks in his home, to the great amazement
of the crab. What shall he do? Every
moment is precious. He rushes to the burrow
of a neighbour and tries to enter, but he
is met by a pair of claws as big as his own.</p>

<p>"How dare you enter my house in such a
rude manner?" perhaps the other exclaims, in
crab language. His whole clumsy body follows
the claws outside, and Mpuke holds his
sides and laughs as the two crabs enter into a
desperate fight.</p>

<p>At this moment there is a scream from one
of the women. Her hand is held tightly in
the claw of the crab she has attacked. Mpuke
rushes up to her, and with one stroke of his
knife cuts away the claw from the crab's body.
But, even now, the hand is held tightly, for
the muscles of the claw have not loosened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
their hold. The woman is faint with the pain,
and keeps on screaming until the claw has
been pried open, and her bruised hand bound
in cooling leaves.</p>

<p>As for the crab, he hurries away as fast as
possible to his own dark, quiet home. There
he probably consoles himself with the thought
that a new claw will grow in course of time,
and take the place of the old one.</p>

<p>After an hour or two of busy work the baskets
are filled, and the party make their way
safely to their homes. There were no accidents,
and not a single hippopotamus was
seen.</p>

<p>The men are all home, and have great news
to tell. Word has reached the village that
white traders are coming this way. Every one
is excited. The stores of ivory must be collected;
the skins of the wild animals must
be collected together; while Mpuke and his
young friends will spend every spare moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
in catching parrots and paroquets, and making
cages for them. The traders may buy them to
carry to children in far-distant lands.</p>

<p>Yes, Mpuke is delighted, above all else,
that he may now be able to buy some beads
for his precious mother.</p>

<p>Perhaps the traders will tell such stories of
their own country that Mpuke will long to
see it. It is even possible that they will grow
fond of the black boy during their stay in this
village, and will invite him to come to America
with them. And perhaps he will accept
the invitation. Who knows?</p>
